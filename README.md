# Django Simple Blog Project
A simple blog project using django, javascript and bootstrap as well as HTML5 and CSS3.

## What it is all about:
This project is a minimal implementation of
[medium.com](https://medium.com/). 

First you should create couple of superusers with django admin. Then these admins create public posts.
Each viewer can leave comment on a post but the author must approve it or the comment will not be shown after the post content.
